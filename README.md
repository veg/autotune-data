# AUTO-TUNE Data Repository

This repository contains datasets utilized in the AUTO-TUNE manuscript for inferring HIV transmission clusters based on genetic distances. AUTO-TUNE employs a heuristic scoring approach to adaptively select a genetic distance threshold, aimed at preventing the formation of excessively large clusters while maximizing the insight into smaller, more meaningful clusters.

## Repository Structure

- `lanl/`: Data extracted from the Los Alamos National Laboratory database.
- `lanl-fl/`: Full-length sequences from LANL database, used for comprehensive analyses.
- `hiv-pol/`: HIV-1 pol gene sequences used in various analyses within the study.
- `hcv/`: Hepatitis C virus sequences used for comparative analyses.
- `clustunr/`: Data related to the clustuneR comparison study.

Each directory contains sequence data and results files from analyses conducted using the AUTO-TUNE methodology.
